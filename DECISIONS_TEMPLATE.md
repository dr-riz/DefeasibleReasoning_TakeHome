# DECISIONS (8â€“10 lines)

- How I map facts to boolean conditions / numeric comparisons:
- How I parse rules (`R#:`) and detect antecedents/consequents:
- How I represent preferences (e.g., `{'R2': priority 2, 'R1': priority 1}`) and break ties:
- When I output `Proved` vs `Disproved` vs `Unknown`:
- Known weaknesses (string brittleness, limited comparators, negation handling):
- Next steps (normalization, symbolic parser, use LLM for rule grounding, unit tests):
- How this scales to bigger datasets (schema, error handling, logging):
- Guardrails or safety checks I would add (bounds, missing fields, noisy input):
